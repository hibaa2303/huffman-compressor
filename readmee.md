## 📁 `README.md` for **Huffman Coding Compressor**

```markdown
# 🗜️ Huffman File Compressor in C++

A text-based file compression tool built using the Huffman coding algorithm. Compresses text input by encoding characters based on frequency.

## 🚀 Features

- Frequency analysis of characters in input
- Priority queue-based binary tree construction
- Generates binary Huffman codes for each character
- Demonstrates core data structure and algorithm concepts

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts**: Huffman Tree, Priority Queue, File I/O, Binary Trees
- **Libraries**: STL (`queue`, `unordered_map`)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Compile the program**:
   ```bash
   g++ huffman.cpp -o huffman
